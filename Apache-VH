Apache Virtual Hosting

- The term Virtual Host refers to the practice of running more than one web site (such as company1.example.com and company2.example.com) on a single machine. 
Virtual hosts can be "IP-based", meaning that you have a different IP address for every web site, or "name-based",
meaning that you have multiple names running on each IP address. The fact that they are running on the same physical server is not apparent to the end user.

- Install httpd / apache2
- edit httpd.conf
