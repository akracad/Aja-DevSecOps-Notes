Node-Js - Build - Deploy - On VM

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.



NPM - Node package Manager

- Npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language maintained by npm, Inc., a subsidiary of GitHub. npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js and is included as a recommended feature in the Node.js installer.

LAB

#Create a VM - Ubuntu
#Install Node and Npm
#Generate Node modules 
#Deploy on Nginx

- Connect to Vm

#update the vm
- sudo apt update

#Install dependencies.
#Install nodejs

- sudo apt install nodejs

#Install npm 
- sudo install npm

#This would download all the packages. 

#Now, build the app
- npm run build

#This will compile and package our app.
#Generate build out-put, that can be deployed.


DEPLOYMENT of Node App - NGINX

Nginx

- Nginx (pronounced "engine x"[8] /ˌɛndʒɪnˈɛks/ EN-jin-EKS, stylized as NGINX or nginx) is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. The software was created by Russian developer Igor Sysoev and publicly released in 2004.[9] Nginx is free and open-source software, released under the terms of the 2-clause BSD license. A large fraction of web servers use Nginx,[10] often as a load balancer.


#Install nginx

- sudo apt install nginx

#Start nginx
- sudo systemctl start nginx

#Copy artifact to root dir

- sudo cp -r /path/to/build /var/www/html

#Edit conf dir
- sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

 >>> root - /var/www/html/build;

#Restart NGINX
- sudo systemctl restart nginx

#Browse app on pub-ip
